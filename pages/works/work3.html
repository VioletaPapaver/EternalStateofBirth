<div><h3>Contrapoesía Libre</h3><br>
    <p>2021-22<br>
    Libro de artista (8 tomos y CD)<br>
    Contrapoesía Libre is an artist book that explores the possibilities of poetry beyond the established paths, both in terms of writing and in the search for new interpretations and possibilities of representation and expression that arise from it. The book is made up of 8 volumes, each one of them displaying the complete development of a counterpoetry, as well as a DVD in which the audiovisuals that appear throughout the books are compiled and linked through QR codes. Each volume starts showing the counterpoetry written in 2 or 3 voices, following the compositional model of musical counterpoint in order to search for new ways of writing that go beyond the conventional. In addition, a QR code links to the listening of the counterpoetry read in several voices simultaneously, at the same time as the 3D spectrogram of this reading is displayed. Next, the cartographies of each voice appear printed on vegetal paper, elaborated from the 3D spectrogram, understanding it as geography by formal analogy and taking advantage of a zenithal view of it to elaborate the cartographic maps corresponding to this sonic territory. Poetries that became sound that became territory by means of losing the meaning first and second the sound. The 2D spectrogram of the voices is then displayed on the pentagram, so that the waveform draws a melodic line. In this way, by translating these lines into musical notation, a score is obtained, which appears as the last section of each volume together with another QR code that leads to the reproduction of this music while the score is visualised. The translation of the waveform lines to melodic lines closes the circle by obtaining music through all this path that started by writing poetry as if it were music, losing the meaning and sound of words to obtain something else, a hidden meaning or inner being of words.</p>
