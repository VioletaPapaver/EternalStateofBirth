    <p>2022<br>
   Live AV performance<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 140px;margin-right: 140px;margin-bottom: 10px;">“Música de Cámara” is an audiovisual performance that takes the literal meaning of the term that gives it its name (chamber music, that in spanish is the same as "camera music"), proposing a kind of concert in which it is first of all the camera that produces its own music by processing the image it collects. A second level is added by the idea of making chamber music (in the conventional sense) together with the camera, completing the whole with a second camera that opens the performance to the audience for interaction. In this way, I, as the artist, become the score that reads the first camera, and the spectator becomes the score of the second camera, these images being divided into their RGB channels to produce different voices. In turn, I form a duo/trio camera grouping with the cams through the control and variation of different visuals that are processed to obtain sounds. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 140px;margin-right: 140px;margin-bottom: 10px;">The work proposes a reinterpretation of the established idea of the concert, where in one way or another there are performers who control and produce sounds, reversing this order through an exercise in sonification. On this occasion, what is ‘produced’ or controlled are visual elements, and it is these that give rise to the sound. The music produced is therefore something that remains out of control, although it is possible to make certain variations through light and colour in a deliberate way, after observing the sound behaviour that the processing of the visual gives rise to.
</p>
    
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 140px;margin-right: 140px;">In "Música de Cámara", the image is allowed to speak. It is not a question of accompanying the visual with the auditory, nor of complementing it, nor of creating the visual in response to the sound. It is about discovering certain possible messages that live in the image beyond the limits of vision, a transfer from the light wave to the sound wave that situates us ourselves as a work, as a score that generates music when read by the performer as well as the camera instrument.</p>
